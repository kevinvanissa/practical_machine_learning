# practical_machine_learning

This repository is used to share an approach that I have used to perform data analysis and predictive modelling. I have included many comments that should assist in understanding the approach that is being demonstrated here. This notebook uses traditional ML models. Therefore, in the future, I will use this same dataset and Deep Learning to see if I can get a better performance without overfitting.
